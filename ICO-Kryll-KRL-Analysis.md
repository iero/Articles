# [ICO] Kryll (KRL) : Analysis

![1_fCvXKKv2HxeHEabRR_02Hw.jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmb832gSxibzcxWzSt5fmvucvZ1scZK5r9DhW99FLo5MkH/1_fCvXKKv2HxeHEabRR_02Hw.jpeg)

[Kryll.io](https://kryll.io/referral/5a7ad95aff75fc17913f316f) is a project, launched by a french team (Cryptense) based in Sophia-Antipolis, for crypto traders.

Kryll is not another 'bot'. It's a **platform**, that would like to make an easier life for traders by allowing them to:
* Build **trading strategies** trough workflows, using a simple and graphical way with chained boxes (eg if the coin goes up by 25%, sell),
* Take into account **feeling analysis** (unstructured data from twitter, facebook, telegram),
* Test strategies on past or live data,
* Run those strategies automatically (huge time savings) on several exchanges (another time savings) and receive push alerts,
* Allow other users to use strategies (against payment) using *'black box'*, and thus, earn money without revealing their recipes. There will be a global ranking of the most popular strategies in some kind of *strategies store*.

## Tokens (KRL)

The entire platform will be free and tokens (KRL) will be used to execute our own trading strategies, or to execute those that others have made available (trough the strategy store).

A total of 220 million KRL tokens will be generated, and a maximum of 144 million will be sold during the ICO. The unsold tokens will be burned.

Tokens should also become exchangeable on exchanges like Cryptopia, kuCoin, hitBTC or Bittrex (to be confirmed).

The KRLs are for sale at a price of 0.2 USD. A minimum investment of 500 KRL (100 USD) is required to participate and can be purchased from BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, ZEC, DASH.

For this, only one method: [Register on the site](https://kryll.io/referral/5a7ad95aff75fc17913f316f), select the currency, retrieve the address of your wallet (it is a unique address created for you) and transfer to it. Payments can be made from an exchange (binance, kraken, coinbase, etc.).

Once done, you need to enter the public address of a *ERC20* **ETH** wallet in your profile. It can be your ledger or a wallet opened on [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com) for example, but not an exchange.

The KRL will be paid from 03/30/2018.

Bonuses are offered for first time buyers :

## My opinion :

Beyond the cool name (food for [Whales](https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-whale/)), Kryll allows traders to save time by building (and testing) their own strategy in minutes (against a few days when done by hand) and leaving the algorithm applying it without having to stay connected all night long.

We can go further by taking into account various signals (from twitter, etc), which is not easy to do today (it requires specific machine learning algorithms, suitable for crypto after cleaning all adverts), and compared to Tradingview, good strategists can be paid.

I selected this ICO because it seems to be a very good project, and useful. The team is very open on [Telegram](https://t.me/kryll_io), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kryll_io) and [Facebook](https://facebook.com/kryll.io) and answered all my questions.

However, I see two risks:
* This product will be used by a limited (traders) community. They must go beyond Europe and attack the international market to have enough volume to support the platform. It will also take a lot of communication to make this project well known and to explain why it is useful.
* Kryll.io is on the same market than other actors like Coinigy or Tradingview. The team need to structure and deliver as quickly as possible, to not let these actors enough time to react. They also need to federate all small developers who have already created multiple libraries and bots, and attract them to this platform (by offering KRL?)

What I would like to see:
* A very aggressive roadmap with an alpha platform and an SDK available to attract developers,
* An interface with [Legolas](https://legolas.exchange/) for an optimal trading tool,
* Be able to add your own sources of information (access to your own machine learning models using simple JSON REST requests),
* Add Reddit to unstructured analytics, as it's easier for machine learning than twitter,
* The ability to apply a strategy on multiple coins at once.
